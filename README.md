# Development

General guidelines and information how to configure the repository for development.

Development Tools
-------
- Visual Studio Code
- [Blender Development Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development)

Tests
-------
Unittests are available under the 'tests/' folder. To run call:

`tests/run.sh <path or alias to Blender executable>`

Running tests require the addon to be installed to the Blender executable, simplest way to do so is to use the Blender development extension with the same executable as it will configure a symlink to the project, ensuring the test will run with the latest changes to the code.

Unittests are minimal and should focus on testing the addon functionality. For functionality testing the importer go to the underlying .c3d parser [project](https://github.com/MattiasFredriksson/py-c3d).


Code Style
-------
- Classes should be in PascalCase
- Variables and functions should be in snake_case
- Code needs to be pep8 compliant (\_\_init\_\_.py has exemptions due to Blender dependencies).

Addon Tooltip Style
-------

- Addon property names should written with the first letter in each word capatilized.
- Don't forget to exclude the dot (.) at the end of the description as it will be added automatically...
